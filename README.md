# Volcano Plugins

A repository with unofficial plugins for Obsidian and [Volcano](https://npmjs.com/volcano). Have one to add? Make a pull request and I'll add your plugin to the repo and give you push access.

To install one, just download one of the files below and put it in the `volcano/plugins/` folder inside your home folder. If that doesn't exist, make sure you've already installed Volcano!

Also, be warned that all these plugins are janky.

- [Checked checkbox deleter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kognise/volcano-plugins/master/checkbox-deleter.js)

**I want to clarify, these are all unofficial plugins based on an unofficial plugin API. As such, please don't bother the nice Obsidian developers with bug reports. Instead report issues through GitHub's interface on either this repository or Volcano.**

Another option is to directly clone this repository into the plugins directory and just selectively enable plugins.

There used to be a Mermaid plugin but it got officially added to Obsidian!
