# Volcano Plugins

A repository with unofficial plugins for Obsidian and [Volcano](https://npmjs.com/volcano). Have one to add? Make a pull request and I'll add your plugin to the repo and give you push access.

To install one, just download one of the files below and put it in the `volcano/plugins/` folder inside your home folder. If that doesn't exist, make sure you've already installed Volcano!

Also, be warned that all these plugins are janky.
